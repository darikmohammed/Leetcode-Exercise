# Where do I find jobs to apply to?

There are plenty of great companies looking for someone just like you to contribute to their growth and success. However, you need to find them, and they need to find you! This is what job searching is all about.

So, to maximize your chances of landing interviews (and your dream job), you'll have to apply to as many relevant offers as you can. If you are wondering where to find jobs to apply to, we've got you. You will find below a list of different types of jobs and places to find them. Feel free to refer back to this list regularly. It will keep you inspired on where to look to find job offers to apply to.

### Wellfound

One of the best sources of jobs offered by startups is Wellfound. You already have an account there, so you should be able to start applying for jobs immediately.

Go to [https://angel.co/jobs](https://angel.co/jobs) and use tags to filter the types of jobs you are interested in.

You should select “Software Engineer” in the “Role” drop-down, select “Remote” and any location that you are interested in in the “Location” drop-down (e.g. if you are willing to relocate to any country in Europe, you can select Europe as location).

You can leave the other filters unused for now. Later on, you can start adding tags such as “React” or “Ruby” or “Ruby on Rails” if you get results that are too broad.

Remember to always filter by Role and Location at least.

To apply for a job on Wellfound, you just have to click on “Apply Now”. If the company also clicks on you, you will get introduced to each other.

Take a look at [this article](https://medium.com/@janineyorio/how-to-land-a-job-through-angellist-25f2ebe25375) from a startup founder that shares some really good tips on how to apply to startups on Wellfound.

### Hacker News

Hacker News is a forum and community created by Y Combinator, the accelerator where Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe got started, among many others.

Hacker News is an amazing source of news and interesting resources for developers, hackers, and founders, and among those resources, a list of companies looking for software developers and freelancers is posted every month.

To find those lists, you can take a look at the [submissions of this account](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring). Every month, you will see two new posts created by that account: one for companies looking for employees, and another one for companies looking for freelancers. You should take a look at both of them. Just scan through the list and notice if there is any company that gets your attention. They will include information about the role and how to apply to it.

Just keep in mind that many of those jobs are only available to people in the US, but not exclusively. [This aggregator site](http://www.hnhiring.me/) also tracks those jobs.

### **Remote job boards**

Remote jobs, as we previously discussed, are a tremendous opportunity for you and have the potential to solve the current disconnection between opportunities and talent. As you know, we are huge fans of remote jobs at Microverse.

Companies (startups among them) who can’t afford or can’t find the right people locally, often start looking for remote software developers to join their teams.

Some companies have been built by distributed/remote teams from the beginning and follow a remote-only philosophy. Some of the best-known companies in that field are Zapier, Trello, GitLab, Buffer, Doist, etc. However, because those companies are leading the current trend of remote-only companies, they can afford to mainly hire only senior developers. But don’t worry, many other companies are hiring remote software engineers, and the best way to find them is to go to websites that are dedicated to remote jobs exclusively.

You should get familiar with the main remote jobs websites:

- [Elpha](https://elpha.com/positions?sort=newest) - Platform to help women in tech, they have an open position section, but not all jobs are remote.

There are also several platforms and talent networks that help match employees with full-time, part-time, and contract developers.

Many of these platforms only accept a small number of applicants, so prepare your application to these platforms with as much care and attention to detail as you would spend on a job application:

- [Arc](https://arc.dev/developer/apply)
- [Nixa](https://www.nixa.io/developers)
- [Andela](https://andela.com/senior-engineers/) (specifically for developers based in Africa who have at least 2 years of experience)

- [Gun.io](https://www.gun.io/) (aimed more for freelancers)
- [X-Team](https://x-team.com/join/)

Other lists of job search venues:

- [https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job/](https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job/)
- [https://dev.to/duomly/18-websites-where-you-can-find-a-remote-job-3a91](https://dev.to/duomly/18-websites-where-you-can-find-a-remote-job-3a91)

If you are interested in remote jobs, you should set up alerts on all those websites and build the habit of checking for new remote jobs there every day.

### **Local job boards**

As we mentioned before, local jobs are not necessarily bad jobs. Just have a clear idea of what you are looking for and keep your eyes open. Every country has its dedicated websites for local jobs (e.g. [Indeed.com](http://indeed.com/) and [Monster.com](http://monster.com/) are two good global websites).

You should also use LinkedIn to find global and local jobs. Since you already have a LinkedIn profile, it should be very easy to get started. Just go to [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) and use their “Easy Apply” option when you find something interesting.

Networking should be an integral part of your local approach too. If you live in a big city, there is probably a group of people who regularly meet together to talk about topics such as Ruby or JavaScript. Try to join them, attend the events, and make connections while you are there. These people often work in local tech companies that might be interested in hiring an intern or entry-level developer. Some of them might even work remotely and can make a strong referral. Worst case scenario, you will meet interesting people and learn about exciting topics.

You should also look for local events such as hackathons where you can meet other people in the industry. We recommend this website to find hackathons around you: [https://devpost.com/hackathons](https://devpost.com/hackathons)

- If you live in the United States, Ireland, Canada, or the United Kingdom, you should consider [Indeed Prime](https://www.indeed.com/prime). Take a look at the kind of personalized job placement service they offer. If you live in the US, another interesting service that you should try is [Hired](https://hired.com/).
- If you are from Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Chile, or Australia, you should also consider trying [Triplebyte](https://triplebyte.com/) to speed up the process of landing a job at one of the big tech companies in the US.

### **Relocation-based job boards**

Unfortunately, there are not many sources exclusively for jobs that offer to cover relocation and immigration costs. However, you can find some platforms like [Jobbatical](https://jobbatical.com/jobs) and [VanHack](https://vanhack.com/) which specialize in that specific niche. If you are interested, check out some of the jobs they have available, create an account, and sign up for their newsletter to get their new job offers.

Another good way to find relocation-based jobs is by applying to jobs in the countries and cities you are interested in (e.g. if you are interested in Europe, use Europe in the search filters of general/global job boards like LinkedIn).

If they decide to interview you, just make sure to disclose that you don’t currently live there but you are open to relocating if they can assist with the visa (if necessary) and relocation costs.
